# Eye Movement Exercise

Description of Project: This project explores how a visual element can be linked to the movement of the mouse cursor. This excercise was also an exploration of how to line up elements using containers and flexbox. 

How to Run: Clone this repository to your local system and open the index.html file. Then move your mouse around the screen to see the effect. 

Roadmap of future improvements: Plans to build out this environment to have the current image of Mona Lisa being one of several gallery images in a museum type environment. I want to explore designing interactive rooms to understand more about user/code interactibility as well as how to design using perspective.
